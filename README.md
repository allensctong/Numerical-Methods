# Numerical-Methods

Numerical methods are used to solve various problems in applied mathematics, such as Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Fixed Point problems, with wide applications in Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science. These problems often have high complexity or fail to have a real solution. Therefore, numerical methods are used to provide accurate approximations that are computationally cheaper.

This repository contains my implementations of several numerical algorithms such as Newton's Method and Linear Shooting algorithm.
