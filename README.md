# Numerical-Methods

Numerical methods are used to solve various problems in applied mathematics, such as Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Fixed Point problems. These problems are often computationally hard to solve or don't have a real root, but numerical methods provide close enough approximations that are computationally cheaper.

This repository contains my implementations of several numerical algorithms such as Newton's Method and Linear Shooting.
