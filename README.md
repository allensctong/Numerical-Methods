# Numerical-Methods

Numerical methods are used to solve various problems in applied mathematics, such as Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Fixed Point problems. This repository contains my implementations of numerical algorithms such as Newton's Method and Linear Shooting. Code written in MatLab.
