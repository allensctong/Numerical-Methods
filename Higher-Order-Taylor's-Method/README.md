My implementation of second and fourth order Taylor's method to solve a partial differential equation (PDE). Error plots also included.

Taylor's method of other orders can be implemented by calculating its corresponding derivatives and following the general pattern in the code:
the Nth order Taylor requires the calculation of up to the (N-1)th derivative of the PDE.

The higher the order, the lower the error.
